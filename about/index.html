			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am currently a graduate student at the University of Washington pursuing a MS degree in Electrical Engineering. My projected graduation date is of June, 2017. Open to work in software industrial before graduation if it is an exciting project.
			   My main research is in Machine Learning and AI. Advised by professor Hannaneh, my recent work is lipreading in phrase level by convolutional neural network by Python, Keras and Tensorflow as backend.
			   Internet of Things is my other main passion. I have interned at a startup team and then won the best prize from AT&T Iot Hackathon in Jul 2016.
			   I enjoy thinking the best way to integrate cutting edge AI technique into end-point devices in our daily life to build intelligent home and city.
